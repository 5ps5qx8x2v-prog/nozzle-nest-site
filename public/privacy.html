      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>
        Payments are processed by <strong>Stripe</strong>. When you check out, you are redirected to Stripe’s secure payment pages.

      </ul>

      <h2>Legal basis</h2>
      <p>
        We process personal data where it is necessary to perform a contract (fulfil your order), comply with legal obligations,
        and for legitimate interests (running and improving the business), where those interests are not overridden by your rights.
      </p>

      <h2>How long we keep your data</h2>
      <p>
        We keep order records for as long as needed for customer support and to meet legal and tax requirements. We do not keep card details.
