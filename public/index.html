            Yes, the name might raise an eyebrow. Yes, people may even ask questions… but no, we’re not changing it.
            Even though the name is a bit strange, Nozzle Nest is a thoroughly practical bit of kit, designed and carefully
            made by me, Simon, in Cowes on the Isle of Wight, UK.

        <h2>What it does</h2>
        <p>
          Nozzle Nest keeps all your nozzles easy to find and perfectly organised. Each nozzle has a secure,
          dedicated place—keeping your tools tidy, easy to grab, and no longer lost or in the bottom of a cupboard somewhere.

    <p class="muted">
  Your Nozzle Nest can be mounted in many different ways, flat against a wall, either horizontal, vertical or even &#8216;on the wonk&#8217;, or by using the brackets supplied it can be mounted at 45 degrees to a surface to save space. Full instructions are sent with the kit.

        <h2>Why it exists</h2>
        <p>
          I set out to make this product so it was memorable, genuinely useful, and long lasting—particularly longer than one’s
          patience when one’s nozzles inevitably get lost. It also needed to be the sort of thing that doesn’t fail after a few uses,
          because that would be no good to anyone. Hopefully, a Nozzle Nest will give you years of faithful service, keep all your nozzles
          exactly where they should be, and quietly prove that the name really is the only strange thing about it.
